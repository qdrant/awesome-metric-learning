üòé Awesome list about practical Metric Learning and its applications

## Motivation ü§ì
At Qdrant, we have one goal: make metric learning more practical. This listing is in line with this purpose, and we aim at providing a concise yet useful list of awesomeness around metric learning. It is intended to be inspirational for productivity rather than serve as a full bibliography.

If you find it useful or like it in some other way, you may want to join our Discord server, where we are running a paper reading club on metric learning.

Learning an Invariant Mapping</a> - First appearance of Contrastive Loss.</summary>

> Published by Yann Le Cun et al. (2005), its main focus was on dimensionality reduction. However, the method proposed has excellent properties for metric learning such as preserving neighbourhood relationships and generalization to unseen data, and it has extensive applications with a great number of variations ever since. It is advised that you read [this great post](https://medium.com/@maksym.bekuzarov/losses-explained-contrastive-loss-f8f57fe32246) to better understand its importance for metric learning.
