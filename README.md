üòé Awesome list about practical Metric Learning and its applications

## Motivation ü§ì
At Qdrant, we have one goal: make metric learning more practical. This listing is in line with this purpose, and we aim at providing a concise yet useful list of awesomeness around metric learning. It is intended to be inspirational for productivity rather than serve as a full bibliography.

If you find it useful or like it in some other way, you may want to join our Discord server, where we are running a paper reading club on metric learning.

> Mining informative negative instances are of central importance to deep metric learning (DML), however this task is intrinsically limited by mini-batch training, where only a mini-batch of instances is accessible at each iteration. In this paper, we identify a "slow drift" phenomena by observing that the embedding features drift exceptionally slow even as the model parameters are updating throughout the training process. This suggests that the features of instances computed at preceding iterations can be used to considerably approximate their features extracted by the current model.
